Reference - Sub-Packages
##########################

You can get an overview of the purpose of the sub-packages from the :ref:`previous section <a_tutorial>`.
The (detailed) description of all user-relevant functions in rivus are listed below. In addition to the documentation of the individual functions, a brief description is provided per sub-package or module to enlighten the used packages or design logic.

.. note::

    Prerequisites:
        In the code examples, we assume that you have a installed rivus (``git clone``) and the required packages for your work. (``conda install`` see in :ref:`installation <a_install>`)

rivus
----------------

The formulation of the :abbr:`MILP (mixed integer linear programming)` model is implemented
with the help of Pyomo_'s ConcreteModel_. That means, the needed constrains are formulated with the help of python functions. These have descriptive names following the ``*_rule`` or ``*_balance`` naming convention. In general, you do not have to touch them.

As for now, the object returned by :func:`create_model()` (often named as ``prob``) serves as the base type of input for the other function. This may change in future versions. But as for now, it is important you get familiar with its format. Following attributes are directly accessible and esp. interesting in the first round.

+ peak : (Pandas.DataFrame) - Maximum demands per edge.
+ r_in, r_out : (Pandas.Series) - Process-Commodity ratios split by direction.
+ params : (dict)
    
    - ``commodity`` - processed Excel sheet
    - ``process`` - processed Excel sheet
    - ``hub`` - filtered version of ``process``
    - ``process_commodity`` - processed Excel sheet
    - ``time`` - processed Excel sheet
    - ``area_demand`` - processed Excel sheet
    - ``vertex`` - processed spatial input
    - ``edge`` - processed spatial input

***********************
rivus\.graph
***********************

Comparison of the common graph analysis tools:

+ NetworkX_ (preferred):

    * `+ /-` Pure python implementation.
    * `+` Widely used and tested.
    * `+` Docs are quite good.
    * `+` Easy (platform independent) installation
    * `-` Slower than igraph (and graph-tools)

+ python-igraph_ (fall-back):

    * `+` C based with python wrappers.
    * `+` Mature library package.
    * `+` Included for speed and so for scalability.
    * `Ã—` Docs are OK.
    * `-` Windows install can be somewhat tedious (with unofficial wheel files). But it works.

+ graph-tools_: (eventually added in the future, if there is reeeaaly big need for efficiency..)

    * `+` Self proclaimed: fastest in graph analyses
    * `-` Not really windows user friendly (docker install should be tested)

These all facilitate pretty advanced graph theoretical analysis. Moreover, the file export functions of the used libraries were bridged through the ``to_graph`` module. Preferred file format is ``.gml`` which is supported by all common graph analysis tools. As such, specialized, stand-alone tools for graph visualisation and analysis can be used. E.g. Gephi_ with its exceptional geolayout_ plug-in can be of tremendous help for deeper graph visualization and analysis.

***********************
rivus\.gridder
***********************

The birth of this module originates to the intention to regard the linear optimization model as a natural phenomenon. As usual approach in natural sciences, we abstract the specific question in focus, removing the "noise" of real-world data and homogenize the otherwise heterogeneous input data.

After gaining understanding of the highly symmetric model, the noise and asymmetries can be added back in an iterative process. Thus testing the validity of our findings.

As the first approach, a symmetric grid generator is implemented, which can be highly parametrized and can create input for :func:`create_model` only in few lines of code.

.. figure:: img/sq_grids1.png
    :scale: 55 %
    :align: center

    Adding noise to the grid. (x, and y edge length can be also set separately.)

Moreover, the possibility to have an input generator integrated into ``rivus`` itself has proven itself useful in many ways. Testing the implemented paradigms can be more intuitive in a symmetric environment, and the ability to rapidly showcase little optimization projects can serve as a demonstration tool accompanying relevant lectures.

.. note::

    A highly symmetric square grid may seem far-fetched from real-life street structures.
    However, remember the `grid street plan`_ which has been around since the Greeks and is to be found all over the world. So, it is maybe not such a bad starting point as considered it may seem at the first glance.

rivus\.db
----------------

To advocate the possibilities provided by a good database connection, 
a throughout description of the set-up process is documented in rivus-db_.
There you can find help from the entry level (install, create database) to more
advanced topics (queries, data archive).

In this module presents a convenient way to interact with your PostgreSQL database.

Store example
::

    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    from rivus.io import db as rdb
    engine = create_engine('postgresql://postgres:pass@localhost/rivus')
    # ...
    # Modelling, Solving, Analysing
    # ...
    this_run = dict(comment='testing graph table and features with networx',
                profiler=profile_log)
    rdb.store(engine, rivus_model, run_data=run_dict)

Import example
::

    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    from rivus.io import db as rdb
    from rivus.main.rivus import create_model
    engine = create_engine('postgresql://postgres:pass@localhost/rivus')
    run_id = 4242
    data_dfs = ['process', 'commodity', 'process_commodity', 'time', 'area_demand']
    data = {df_name: rdb.df_from_table(engine, df_name, run_id)
            for df_name in data_dfs}
    vertex = rdb.df_from_table(engine, 'vertex', run_id)
    edge = rdb.df_from_table(engine, 'edge', run_id)

    prob = create_model(data, vertex, edge, hub_only_in_edge=False)

`Example queries <http://rivus-db.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#report-analysis>`_  with results and short descriptions are part of the separate documentation.

rivus\.plot
----------------

Interactive 3D data visualization! See live example `here <https://plot.ly/~lnksz/46/>`_ (May take a while to load.)

.. only:: html

   .. figure:: img/3dplot.gif

      Demo of a 3D interactive plot.

Plotly has a great `documentation <https://plot.ly/python/reference/#scatter3d>`_ and an extensive
`examples library <https://plot.ly/python/>`_.

It is available also available as a JavaScript library, which can help when a web-app GUI is added to rivus. (Client-side visualization.)

To ensure interoperability, it thinks in dictionaries (JSONs). This gives a greater flexibility then e.g. the API of matplotlib.

Adding extra hove-over information (line length, capacity, you-name-it) is also highly flexible.

The structure can be explained easily:
::

    data = cap_layers + hub_layer + markers
    fig = dict(data=data, layout=layout)

where ``cap_layers``, ``hub_layer`` and ``markers`` simply lists of dictionaries are, which dictionaries have the key-value pairs of the `Scatter3d <https://plot.ly/python/reference/#scatter3d>`_ structure (class).

We use raw dicts instead of Plotly's "classes" because they are mainly the same, but much faster.
Still, Loading the plot can take a while if there are a lot of elements to render. (For each edge we have a scatter3d dict in the ``data`` list, which are grouped together by the same ``legendgroup`` key value.)

The plot consists of layers, stacked upon each other. Each of these represent a commodity. All of the edges are shown in each layer, but if in one no carrier was built, it is displayed dashed. If the edge is stroked through, some amount of capacity was built out there. The width of the edges are in proportion with that amount.

Diamond shapes represent the sources in the vertices.

Vertical lines show processes (commodity conversions).

All of the elements can be toggled with the help of the menu in the upper right corner.

.. note::

    As the legends (with which you can turn off/on the layers) are generated from the first elements per legend-groups in the data list, there are now dummies as first ones to ensure a nicer look.
