# This is a conda environment setup file.
# Mainly it is used by readthedocs to create a virt-env for flexigisnetz and
# install the dependencies. 
# Note: Install Skeletron manually from https://github.com/haukebents/Skeletron
# Note: geopandas is from pip, so that it does not mess up the fiona install.
# Note: You could also install from this with 
# $ conda env create -f environment.yml
